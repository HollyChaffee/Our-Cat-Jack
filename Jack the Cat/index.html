		<h2>Hello! Welcome to my webpage all about our cat Jack.</h2>
	
		<h3>We have been told by cat lovers and non-cat lovers that Jack is a cat among cats. He likes to think he is and so do we. </h3>

<p>Jack is a <em>Japanese Bobtail</em>. After meeting Jack, many people ask, <strong>"What happened to his tail?" "Well, he was born that way!"</strong> is always our reply. Each Japanese Bobtail cat has a short tail, rarely longer than three inches. If you feel the tail, you will notice that it has a hook in it. It is said that each cat has their own unique hook in their tail.</p>

<p><em>Japanese Bobtails</em> are fun-loving, energetic, curious, adventurous, and affectionate. They think everyone should love cats and be their friend. They are also highly intelligent. They will learn and respond to their given name. They can learn tricks and will figure things out on their own. They are known for their sweet, melodious tone, considered by many to be a sing-song voice. You can talk to them just like you would another person and they will respond back with all kinds of little chirps, mrrrs, and other sounds that will convince you they surely understand every word you are saying and have something to say in return.</p> 

<p><em>Japanese Bobtails</em> are small-medium sized cats ranging in weight from 8-12 pounds. Their coat is silky soft and they tend to shed less than other breeds, although this does not mean that they do not shed because they do! They are extremely social and affectionate. They prefer to be wherever you are and due to their curiousity, will want to regularly see what you are up to and if they can be of any help. They are affectionate and prefer the company of people or at least other animals.</p>

<p><strong>Next time you visit an Asian restaurant or store, take notice of the ceramic cat on the counter with the waving paw. The Maneki-neko, meaning <em>beckoning cat,</em> is modeled after the <em>Japanese Bobtail!</em> They are considered by many to bring good fortune upon the owner's establishment.</strong></p><br>

<p><strong>I personally don't see the difference, except maybe the waving paw?</strong></p>
		
	<h3>On any given day we will find Jack in any number of places and positions. He does enjoy sleeping more now that he is fourteen years old!</h3>

			<p>True to his breed, Jack has a fun and adventurous personality. He loves to go outside to explore and hunt. We will often see him racing across the yard and going up and down trees. He has been an excellent hunter, keeping the mouse and mole population away from our house. Inside, he will play with balls, race around the house, try to discover what is inside any closed door or cabinet, help me with my exercise routine, help my husband with the yard work, or sleeping-of course sleeping. He is still a cat after all.</p><br>

			<h3>Although Jack likes to sleep, he is still a very curious, playful cat.</h3>

				<p>Jack has figured out how to open drawers and cabinets. Who knew we would need child locks after the kids grew up! He has watched us open the doors to the house enough times that he thinks he should be able to do the same. He will get up on his hind legs and reach his paws around the doorknob trying to open the door. He has not succeeded at this yet, thank goodness! Unfortunately, I have not captured a picture of him doing the doorknob thing, but here are a few examples of his desire to see what is behind a closed cabinet door or in a drawer! He absolutely thinks all doors should be open and will sometimes go on a quest to accomplish this task. Thankfully it is not every day!</p> 

				<p><em><strong>Look carefully at the photo of him crouching down outside and see if you can find the predator he has his eye on.</strong></em></p>
